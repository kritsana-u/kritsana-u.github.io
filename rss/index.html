Many clients have their own AWS account and provided us IAM to access to their AWS resources. Now, I have many accounts that switching between them is painful.</p><p>According to the AWS document at link below,<br><a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.aws.amazon.com%2Fsinglesignon%2Flatest%2Fuserguide%2Fmanage-your-accounts.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/manage-your-accounts.html</a></p><p>It say:</p><blockquote>“You can also connect an AWS account that is not part of your organization by setting up the account as a custom SAML application in AWS SSO. In this scenario, you provision and manage the IAM roles and trust relationships that are required to enable SSO access. For more information on how to do this, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/samlapps.html#addconfigcustomapp" rel="noopener">Add and Configure a Custom SAML 2.0 Application</a>.”</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the document does not provide the setup steps for that (at least on the day I wrote this article). I kept searching on Google and I found that someone share such information. I followed the steps, and it does not work. After trial and error for a while, finally I can make it :)</p><h3 id="step-1-create-aws-sso-application-">Step 1 – Create AWS SSO Application:</h3><ul><li>Sign in to your AWS master account to which you SSO account belong.</li><li>Go to AWS Single Sign-On service and select <strong>Applications</strong> from the sidebar on the left and you will see the list of AWS SSO applications you have.</li><li>Click <strong>Add a new application</strong> button.
